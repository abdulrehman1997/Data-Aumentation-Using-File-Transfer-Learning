Project Title:Data Augmentation using Image style transfer

Team Members: Abdul Rehman, Ashwin Bhat

Project Guide:Prof. Ramesh H Bhat

Abstract: Historically, Deep Learning Models have required a massive amount of data to be trained on so that they produce results which have high accuracy and results which do not over-fit. But most of the times for experiments, researchers or machine learning enthusiasts end up not having a data-set which is big enough which can be used to train the model.
A common practice which is used to over-come this problem is to augment the existing data-set using the technique of Data Augmentation.
This process aims to use the existing data-set and perform a set of actions on it to slightly change the properties of the data and create new data with this new set of properties. There are various ways which can be used to change the properties of existing data-sets such as rotation, flipping, translation, scaling, adding noise, changing lighting conditions, perspective transform and many more.
We aim to use a technique called Image Style Transfer for the purpose of Data Augmentation.
Style Transfer is applying a style of another image or a random style on the content of an image so as to change its intrinsic properties such as illumination.

Steps To Excecute:
1. Make Sure all the code files are in the same folder
2. Make Sure the dataset files has images of size 224*224
3. Makes sure the Images are number in numerical order (1.Jpg,2.Jpg,3.Jpg,.......,N.Jpg)
4. Run the UI>py by calling python3.6 UI.py
5. Select the data set to be augmented and type the final number of images required.
6. click on augment
